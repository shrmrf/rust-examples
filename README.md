# Rust Examples
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/shrmrf/rust-examples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/shrmrf/rust-examples)

I created this repository to present some simple code for people interested in my company in learning the Rust programming language.

### Rust 
Rust is a systems programming language that is safe, fast and modern. People like safe and fast.

### Todo
- Maybe add more `CLONE_` syscalls to the `container-demo-rs` project.
- Use a crate for multi-threading example.
